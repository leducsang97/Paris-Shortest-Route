# Paris-Shortest-Route
How to visit 10 most famous places in Paris in the shortest amount of time?

In this project, I present a realistic problem that can be optimized by linear programming (LP).
This is a example of travelling salesman problem. The LP is written as an integer linear programming and solved by Gurobi.
My first attemp is brute force in which I try any possible solution to find the shortest time. This solution only works with small number of places.
To boost up the process of solving problem, I use Gurobi optimizer.

Thank you very much.
